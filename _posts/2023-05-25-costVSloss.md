| Cost       | The cost function measures the overall performance of a model by calculating the average difference between predicted and actual values. It quantifies the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.                          |
| Loss       | The loss function, also known as the objective function, is used to quantify the error or discrepancy between predicted and actual values for a specific task. It guides the model during training by providing a signal for adjusting the model's parameters.                                    |
| Probability | In deep learning, probability refers to the likelihood or chance that a particular event or outcome will occur. It is often used in classification tasks to estimate the probability of an input belonging to a certain class.                                        |

The cost function measures the modelâ€™s error on a group of objects, whereas the loss function deals with a single data instance.
